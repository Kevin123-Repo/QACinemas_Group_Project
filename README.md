# Simple Web App

Make sure to run `npm i` in both the front-end and back-end to install any dependencies needed for the project.

# Back-end

The back-end was created using Express. 
The database used was MongoDB

##Setup
Make sure to enter the .env file in the backend folder and replace the mongo_url to your own MongoDB URI.
## Available Scripts

In the back-end you can run:

### `npm start`
This runs the app
### `npm test`
This will run the tests for the back-end
Before running npm test you will need to replace the id with an actual id from your database to ensure the tests will pass.
You will see a comment to instruct you where changes are needed.

# Getting Started with Create React App
The front-end was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
